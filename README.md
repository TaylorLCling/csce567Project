# General Plan

* [This is the data source](https://www.admin.sc.gov/accountability-portal/state-salaries)

Here are some sample records:

```
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE	LEMOINE	 LEIGH	ADMINISTRATION-GOV OFFICE	$91,985.00 		$91,985.00 
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE	MCMASTER	 HENRY	AGENCY HEAD	$106,078.00 		$106,078.00 
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE	WALKER	 EDGAR	EXECUTIVE STAFF-GOV OFFICE	$165,000.00 		$165,000.00 
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE	WINDSOR	 TOMMY	ADMINISTRATION-GOV OFFICE	$50,400.00 		$50,400.00 
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE	QUATTRONE	 KRISTY	ADMINISTRATION-GOV OFFICE	$70,173.00 		$70,173.00 
```

The schema seems to be

* Name
* Agency
* Job Title
* Compensation without Bonuses
* Bonuses	Total Compensation

I think there are a couple of different things it would be interesting to look
at here

* Salary histogram by:

	* Office
	* Position

* Some way of comparing salary for a given position with respect to department.

	* Maybe a bubble chart like gap minder, with one axis being salary, one
	  axis being position, and color-coding the offices?
