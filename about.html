<h3>State of SC Salary Information Visualization</h3>

	Copyright (c) 2019 Charles Daniels, Taylor Clingenpeel, Omari Richards, all
	rights reserved.

	Completed to satisfy the requirements of University of South Carolina CSCE567
	Project-01.

	This project visualizes the most up to date (as of March 03 2019) state of SC
	salary data. The state of SC has a policy of making the pay rate of all
	government employees who make more than 50000 USD per year public information.

	This project presents two styles of visualization, in two variations each:

	"Bubble Chart" visualizations are designed to show how salary rates stratify
	across both agency and job title. Either agency or job title may be selected
	for horizontal positioning, and the other parameter will be used to generate
	colors for each "bubble" (which represents a single person's salary, agency,
	and job title). In this style of visualization, clear stratification can been
	seen across different agencies and job titles. This view is not intended to
	provide a detailed accounting of each individual's salary data, however a
	separate bubble is drawn for each data point -- this lets the data speak for
	itself and the human eye detect the strata, rather than attempting to identify
	them algorithmicaly. In this view, mousing over a single bubble will highlight
	all other bubbles which share it's color (whatever parameter is not used for
	horizontal grouping).

	"Bar Chart" visualizations are designed to show the distribution of salary data
	for different agencies and job titles. Mousing over a single bar in either of
	the bar chart views views will show the breakdown of whichever data point is
	not used for horizontal grouping (i.e. mousing over a bar in the salary vs
	agency chart will show the breakdown of agencies contained within that bar in a
	tooltip).

	We feel that these visualizations are collectively representative of different
	types of information people might wish to examine with respect to SC salary
	data:

	How salaries stratify across different agencies and roles
	How salaries are distributed across roles irrespective of agency
	How salaries are distributed across agencies irrespective of role
