<h3>State of SC Salary Information Visualization</h3>

	<p>
		Completed to satisfy the requirements of University of South Carolina CSCE567<br>
		Project-01.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project visualizes the most up to date (as of March 03 2019) state of SC<br>
		salary data. The state of SC has a policy of making the pay rate of all<br>
		government employees who make more than 50000 USD per year public information.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project presents two styles of visualization, in two variations each:
	</p>
	<p>
		"Bubble Chart" visualizations are designed to show how salary rates stratify<br>
		across both agency and job title. Either agency or job title may be selected<br>
		for horizontal positioning, and the other parameter will be used to generate<br>
		colors for each "bubble" (which represents a single person's salary, agency,<br>
		and job title). In this style of visualization, clear stratification can been<br>
		seen across different agencies and job titles. This view is not intended to<br>
		provide a detailed accounting of each individual's salary data, however a<br>
		separate bubble is drawn for each data point -- this lets the data speak for<br>
		itself and the human eye detect the strata, rather than attempting to identify<br>
		them algorithmicaly. In this view, mousing over a single bubble will highlight<br>
		all other bubbles which share it's color (whatever parameter is not used for<br>
		horizontal grouping).
	</p>
	<p>
		"Bar Chart" visualizations are designed to show the distribution of salary data<br>
		for different agencies and job titles. Mousing over a single bar in either of<br>
		the bar chart views views will show the breakdown of whichever data point is<br>
		not used for horizontal grouping (i.e. mousing over a bar in the salary vs<br>
		agency chart will show the breakdown of agencies contained within that bar in a<br>
		tooltip).
	</p>
	<p>
		We feel that these visualizations are collectively representative of different<br>
		types of information people might wish to examine with respect to SC salary<br>
		data:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			How salaries stratify across different agencies and roles
		</li>
		<li>	
			How salaries are distributed across roles irrespective of agency
		</li>
		<li>
			How salaries are distributed across agencies irrespective of role
		</li>
	</ul>
